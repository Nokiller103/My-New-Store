    A[User] -->|Visits Website| B[Frontend - React]

```

This diagram illustrates the flow of data and interactions in the project:

1. The user accesses the application via the browser.
2. The frontend (React) handles the user interface and communicates with the backend (Express.js).
3. The backend processes requests and interacts with the MongoDB database to fetch or store data.
4. Zustand manages application state for smooth user experience.
5. Postman is used to test and validate API endpoints.
6. The application is hosted on Render, ensuring consistent availability and performance.
